# Sorry 15-year old self, youâ€™ll like school one day

When I first started learning software, I was 15 and thought, "I never need to go to school for this". Every piece of information I needed was out there on the internet. Well, this is still true; probably none of my questions will remain unanswered. But here's the thing; this was me when 15 -and now I'm 21 and a computer engineering student. And I can say **I WAS WRONG**.

School gave me lots of things. First of all, college is undoubtedly a unique experience that I would be sorry if I'd miss. But besides that, information-wise, I learnt a lot too. 

Let me roll back. I have always been a self-learner; I learnt from videos and documentations. And this comes with a downside: ***you never know what you don't know and when there's no one around to show you that, you never learn about it.*** College helped me with that a lot. I learnt in a way that was structured and planned.

When I think about it, one can do it with online courses too, but I am very distracted and not really disciplined, so somebody has to force me into a plan. 

I don't believe college is the only way or the right way, but a college degree or a structured course plan can be very helpful for a person like myself.
